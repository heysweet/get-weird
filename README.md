# Get Weird
Sebrand and Maegan are teaming up to make some artsy web experiments.

Our goal is to make things every day as quick explorations so we can better understand our capabilities and limits.

We'll be trading off on making something new each day or building on top of something that the other person made. All new projects will be listed on https://mclawges22.github.io/get-weird/index.html

Wanna join in on the fun? Hit us up!
